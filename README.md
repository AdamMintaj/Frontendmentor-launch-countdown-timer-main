# Frontend Mentor - Launch countdown timer

## Overview

This repository holds my solution to the [Launch countdown timer challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/launch-countdown-timer-N0XkGfyz-). Frontend Mentor challenges are frontend exercices where you can test yourself, improve your coding or generally try new things while building realistic projects.

## The challenge

The challenge here was fairly simple and it was to build a site with a countdown timer and some hover states. There was also a bonus challenge to make the card flip when the number changes.

## How it went

I completed this challenge quite some time ago so there's some things I'd do differently if I were to do it again today. Anyway, building a counter isn't particularly difficult so when making this I focused mainly on the difficult part, which was the bonus challenge to make the cards flip. The result is kinda wobbly and lags sometimes but I wanted to see how well I could do without using npm packages or copypasting someone else's code from the internet. In the future I will definitely want to do it again and check whether I'd be able to improve it with what I've learned since that time.
